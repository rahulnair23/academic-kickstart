abstract: 'A new concept in intraoperative decision support for tumour delineation is proposed showing that artificial intelligence provides categorising information and interpretation from the images captured during fluorescence-guided colorectal cancer operations. This is potentially applicable to all cancer subtypes and is pertinent to new fluorophore development.A new concept in intraoperative decision support for tumour delineation is proposed showing that artificial intelligence provides categorising information and interpretation from the images captured during fluorescence-guided colorectal cancer operations.
